#define kUltraSignupHTMLAbout @"<style>p{font-family:helvetica}</style><p>UltraSignup started as a project designed to change online registration forever. We are a technology company with a passion for trail running. We believe that quality running events begin at the point of registration and continue over time with properly organized results. We believe we set the gold standard for both registration and results.</p><p>Most registration companies cast a large net to offer generic registration services to everyone and everything. UltraSignup offers specialized services for trail running events. We serve events that are normally ignored by other registration companies. Our customer service is second to none and our pricing the same. We are available 24/7 and will personally answer your call immediately. Think were are joking? Try us: 1-866-472-6937. Many events view us as an additional member of their staff. Why don't you?</p><p>With our database, we are able to cross reference participants and their past results and link them to upcoming events. Since inception, we have loaded and archived every trail running event that we are aware of. Use our search box at the top of every page to find races that you have participated in.</p><p>We seldom advertise and rarely make sales calls. We strongly believe that our service and value will sell itself. If you are not using UltraSignup for your event, the math is simple, you are losing money. With over 40,000 trail running members, we will funnel more registrants your way, and charge less while doing it.</p>"
